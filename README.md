# Construction Portfolio Analytics: Real-World SPI/CPI Mapping

## 📊 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the ability to ingest external construction industry data and transform it into a professional project management dashboard using Python.

## 🛠️ Technical Achievements
- **Data Engineering:** Ingested and cleaned a real-world CSV dataset, mapping raw dates and costs to industry-standard KPIs.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Implemented **Earned Value Management (EVM)** logic to calculate SPI and CPI for hundreds of construction tasks.
- **Strategic Visualization:** Developed a performance quadrant plot to identify "Danger Zone" tasks (Over-budget and Behind-schedule).
- **Tooling:** Utilised Python (Pandas/Seaborn) as a high-speed alternative to manual Primavera P6 reporting.

## 🐍 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
