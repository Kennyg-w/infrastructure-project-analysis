# 🏗️ Cheatsheet: Real-World Construction Analytics (EVM)

## 1. Professional Metrics
| Metric | Full Name | Calculation | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SPI** | Schedule Performance Index | Planned / Actual Duration | < 1.0 means project is delayed. |
| **CPI** | Cost Performance Index | Planned / Actual Cost | < 1.0 means project is over budget. |

## 2. Key Observations
*   **Performance Quadrants:** The visualisation segments tasks into four performance tiers.
*   **Data Integrity:** The dataset was cleaned to handle inconsistent durations and simulate realistic cost variances based on construction industry standards.
*   **Critical Path:** Projects with an SPI < 0.8 are flagged as "Critical Risks" requiring immediate stakeholder intervention.

## 3. Interview Pitch
> "I ingested a raw construction dataset and mapped its variables to Earned Value Management (EVM) standards. I built a performance quadrant dashboard that identifies project health at scale. By visualizing the SPI vs. CPI relationship, I can instantly isolate systemic delays across a portfolio of hundreds of tasks—a vital skill for maintaining fleet readiness at sites like HMNB Clyde."
